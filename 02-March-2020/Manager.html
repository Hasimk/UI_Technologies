<p >Respected Sir/Madam</p>
<p ><span>Sub:</span><br/> <b><u> Request letter to issue a new ATM card ,</u></b></p>

<p><big>I had opened an account in your "<ins>Bank of baroda</ins>" a few months back. "<del>But somehow</del>", I didn't apply for the ATM card at that time. I have been doing the withdrawal process and other transaction processes through the bank only. Henceforth, I want to use ATM card to debit money as the same may save my time. So, kindly grant me a new ATM card as soon as possible. I would be very thankful to you for this kind act.
Thanking you</big></p>

<p class ="p2">Yours Sincerely</p>
