<span> HTML:-</span> <br/>
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. 
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. 
</p>
<p align="justify"> <br/>
<span>CSS:-</span>
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. 

</p>

<p align="justify"><br/>
<span>JavaScript:-</span>
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language for computers. It is often run in web browser applications to create things that work by themselves like a popup message or a live clock. It is not related to the programming language Java. 
Although Java and JavaScript have many external similarities such as name and syntax, the two languages follow different design principles. 
</p>

<p align="justify"><br/>
<span>Bootstarp:-</span>
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
